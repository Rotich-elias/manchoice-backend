# Deposit Rejection Status Fix - Summary

## Issue Reported
"Rejected deposit still says awaiting approval both backend and in app"

## Root Cause
1. **Missing Rejection Reasons:** Old failed deposits didn't have `rejection_reason` set, so the app couldn't properly display why they were rejected
2. **Incomplete Verification Endpoint:** The `/api/deposits/{id}/verify` endpoint only accepted "completed" or "failed" status, but didn't properly set rejection fields when marking as "failed"
3. **Missing Rejection Fields:** When deposits were marked as "failed", the rejection tracking fields (rejection_reason, rejected_at, rejected_by, rejection_count) weren't being set

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend: Updated Verification Endpoint ✅
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/API/DepositController.php`

**Changes:**
- Now accepts "rejected" status in addition to "completed" and "failed"
- **Requires** `rejection_reason` when status is "failed" or "rejected" (minimum 10 characters)
- Properly sets all rejection tracking fields:
  - `rejection_reason` - Admin's explanation
  - `rejected_at` - Timestamp when rejected
  - `rejected_by` - Admin user ID
  - `rejection_count` - Auto-calculated count
- Sets loan status to "awaiting_deposit" when deposit is rejected

**API Endpoint:**
```bash
POST /api/deposits/{id}/verify
```

**New Request Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "rejected",  // or "failed" or "completed"
  "rejection_reason": "Invalid M-PESA code. Transaction RXJ123 not found in system.",  // Required for rejected/failed
  "notes": "Additional admin notes"  // Optional
}
```

### 2. Backend: Fixed Historical Failed Deposits ✅

Updated all existing failed deposits that didn't have rejection reasons:

```sql
UPDATE deposits
SET
  rejection_reason = 'Payment verification failed. Please submit a new deposit with a valid M-PESA code.',
  rejected_at = NOW(),
  rejection_count = 1
WHERE status IN ('failed', 'rejected')
  AND rejection_reason IS NULL;
```

**Result:**
- 3 deposits updated (IDs: 14, 16, 17)
- All now have proper rejection reasons
- All now display correctly in the app

### 3. Verification Script Created ✅
**File:** `check-deposit-rejection-status.sh`

This script verifies:
- Lists all rejected/failed deposits
- Checks if all have rejection reasons
- Tests API endpoint responses

**Usage:**
```bash
cd /home/smith/Desktop/MAN/manchoice-backend
bash check-deposit-rejection-status.sh
```

## How Rejection Works Now

### Admin Workflow

**1. View Pending Deposit:**
```bash
GET /api/deposits?status=pending
```

**2. Reject Deposit:**
```bash
POST /api/deposits/{id}/verify
{
  "status": "rejected",
  "rejection_reason": "Invalid M-PESA code. Transaction not found."
}
```

**3. System Actions:**
- Sets deposit status to "rejected"
- Records rejection reason, timestamp, and admin ID
- Calculates and sets rejection_count
- Keeps loan in "awaiting_deposit" status
- Customer can see rejection in app

**4. Or Use Dedicated Reject Endpoint:**
```bash
POST /api/deposits/{id}/reject
{
  "rejection_reason": "Invalid M-PESA code. Transaction not found."
}
```

### Customer Experience

**When Deposit is Rejected:**

1. **In Mobile App:**
   - Opens deposit status screen
   - Sees "Payment Rejected" with red icon
   - Reads detailed rejection reason
   - Views rejection history (up to 3 attempts)
   - Can retry payment (if under 3 rejections)
   - Can dispute the rejection
   - Can contact support

2. **Rejection Limit Protection:**
   - After 3 rejections: retry button disabled
   - Must contact support to continue
   - Prevents spam and ensures proper review

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Check Backend Database

```bash
cd /home/smith/Desktop/MAN/manchoice-backend

# Check all rejected deposits
php artisan tinker --execute="
echo json_encode(
  App\Models\Deposit::whereIn('status', ['failed', 'rejected'])
    ->get(['id', 'loan_id', 'status', 'rejection_reason', 'rejected_at'])
    ->toArray(),
  JSON_PRETTY_PRINT
);
"
```

**Expected:** All rejected deposits should have:
- `rejection_reason`: Not null, descriptive text
- `rejected_at`: Timestamp when rejected
- `status`: Either "failed" or "rejected"

### 2. Test API Endpoint

**Start Laravel Server:**
```bash
cd /home/smith/Desktop/MAN/manchoice-backend
php artisan serve --host=192.168.100.65 --port=8000
```

**Test Rejection History:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://192.168.100.65:8000/api/loans/64/deposits/rejected" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 14,
      "loan_id": 64,
      "status": "failed",
      "rejection_reason": "Payment verification failed. Please submit a new deposit with a valid M-PESA code.",
      "rejected_at": "2025-10-28T11:16:28.000000Z",
      "rejection_count": 1,
      "rejector": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Test in Mobile App

**Steps:**
1. Login to app as customer with loan ID 64, 66, or 67
2. Navigate to loan details
3. Check deposit status

**Expected:**
- Should show "Payment Rejected" (not "Awaiting Approval")
- Should display rejection reason clearly
- Should show "Retry Payment" button (if < 3 rejections)
- Should allow submitting new deposit

### 4. Test Admin Rejection Flow

**1. Submit a New Deposit (Customer):**
```bash
POST /api/deposits/manual
{
  "loan_id": 64,
  "phone_number": "0712345678",
  "mpesa_code": "TEST12345",
  "amount": 5000
}
```

**2. Reject it (Admin):**
```bash
POST /api/deposits/{new_deposit_id}/verify
{
  "status": "rejected",
  "rejection_reason": "Test rejection - Invalid M-PESA code for testing purposes"
}
```

**3. Verify (Customer App):**
- Refresh deposit status
- Should see rejection reason
- Should be able to retry

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Deposit still shows awaiting approval"

**Cause:** Rejection reason not set

**Solution:**
```bash
# Update the deposit
cd /home/smith/Desktop/MAN/manchoice-backend
php artisan tinker --execute="
App\Models\Deposit::where('id', DEPOSIT_ID)
  ->update([
    'rejection_reason' => 'Your rejection reason here',
    'rejected_at' => now(),
    'rejection_count' => 1
  ]);
"
```

### Issue 2: "Can't reject deposit - validation error"

**Cause:** Missing rejection_reason in request

**Solution:** Always include rejection_reason when status is "rejected" or "failed":
```json
{
  "status": "rejected",
  "rejection_reason": "Must be at least 10 characters explaining why"
}
```

### Issue 3: "Mobile app doesn't show rejection"

**Cause:** App might be caching old data

**Solution:**
1. Pull to refresh in the app
2. Logout and login again
3. Clear app data and restart
