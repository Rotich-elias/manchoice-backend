# Deposit Rejection Logic - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Complete deposit payment rejection logic has been implemented for both the mobile app (Flutter) and backend (Laravel).

---

## Backend Implementation (COMPLETED ✅)

### 1. Database Migration ✅
**File:** `database/migrations/2025_10_28_104739_add_rejection_fields_to_deposits_table.php`

**Changes:**
- Added `rejected` status to enum
- Added 4 new columns:
  - `rejection_reason` (TEXT, nullable)
  - `rejected_at` (TIMESTAMP, nullable)
  - `rejected_by` (BIGINT, foreign key to users)
  - `rejection_count` (INT, default 0)
- Added indexes for performance:
  - `rejected_by`
  - `loan_id + status` (composite)

**Status:** Migration run successfully ✅

### 2. Deposit Model Updates ✅
**File:** `app/Models/Deposit.php`

**New Fields:**
- `rejection_reason`, `rejected_at`, `rejected_by`, `rejection_count`

**New Relationships:**
- `rejector()` - BelongsTo User relationship

**New Methods:**
- `hasReachedRejectionLimit()` - Check if 3+ rejections
- `canRetry()` - Check if retry is allowed
- `scopeRejected($query)` - Query scope for rejected deposits
- `scopeByLoan($query, $loanId)` - Query scope by loan ID

### 3. API Endpoints ✅
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/API/DepositController.php`

**Updated Endpoints:**

#### GET `/api/loans/{loan}/deposit/status`
Now includes rejection information:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "deposit_required": true,
    "deposit_amount": 5000.00,
    "deposit_paid": 0.00,
    "remaining_deposit": 5000.00,
    "is_deposit_paid": false,
    "deposits": [...],
    "rejection_count": 2,              // NEW
    "has_reached_rejection_limit": false,  // NEW
    "can_retry": true                  // NEW
  }
}
```

**New Endpoints:**

#### GET `/api/loans/{loan}/deposits/rejected`
Get all rejected deposits for a loan:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "loan_id": 5,
      "amount": 5000.00,
      "status": "rejected",
      "rejection_reason": "Invalid M-PESA code",
      "rejected_at": "2025-10-28T10:30:00",
      "rejected_by": 1,
      "rejection_count": 1,
      "rejector": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Admin User"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### POST `/api/deposits/{id}/reject`
Admin endpoint to reject a deposit:
```bash
curl -X POST http://192.168.100.65:8000/api/deposits/1/reject \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "rejection_reason": "Invalid M-PESA code. Transaction not found."
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Deposit rejected successfully",
  "data": {
    "deposit": {...},
    "rejection_count": 1,
    "has_reached_limit": false
  }
}
```

### 4. Routes ✅
**File:** `routes/api.php`

**New Routes:**
```php
Route::get('loans/{loan}/deposits/rejected', [DepositController::class, 'getRejectionHistory']);
Route::post('deposits/{id}/reject', [DepositController::class, 'rejectDeposit']);
```

**New Methods:**
- `submitDepositRejectionDispute()` - Create dispute ticket
- `submitRejectionLimitSupport()` - Request help when limit reached

---

## Business Logic

### Rejection Flow

**Normal Flow (< 3 rejections):**
1. Customer submits deposit payment
2. Admin reviews and rejects with reason
3. `rejection_count` increments
4. Customer receives notification
5. Customer can:
   - View rejection reason and history
   - Retry payment immediately
   - Dispute the rejection
6. Loan stays in `awaiting_deposit` status

**Limit Reached Flow (3+ rejections):**
1. Customer's 3rd payment is rejected
2. Retry button disabled
3. Customer sees limit warning
4. Customer must contact support
5. Support ticket auto-populated with details
6. Admin manually reviews and assists

### Validation Rules

**Backend Validation:**
- Rejection reason: required, minimum 10 characters
- Cannot reject completed deposits
- Cannot reject already rejected deposits
- Rejection count auto-calculated per loan

**Frontend Validation:**
- Show remaining attempts (3 - rejection_count)
- Disable retry after 3 rejections
- Require support contact when limit reached

---

## Testing

### Database Verification ✅
```bash
cd /home/smith/Desktop/MAN/manchoice-backend
php artisan tinker --execute="print_r(array_keys(App\Models\Deposit::first()->getAttributes()));"
```

**Result:** All new fields present ✅
- rejection_reason ✅
- rejected_at ✅
- rejected_by ✅
- rejection_count ✅

### API Testing Script ✅
**File:** `test-deposit-rejection.sh`

Tests all new endpoints:
1. GET `/api/loans/{loan}/deposit/status`
2. GET `/api/loans/{loan}/deposits/rejected`
3. POST `/api/deposits/{id}/reject`

---

## API Usage Examples

### 1. Check Deposit Status with Rejection Info

```bash
curl -X GET "http://192.168.100.65:8000/api/loans/1/deposit/status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### 2. Get Rejection History

```bash
curl -X GET "http://192.168.100.65:8000/api/loans/1/deposits/rejected" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### 3. Reject a Deposit (Admin)

```bash
curl -X POST "http://192.168.100.65:8000/api/deposits/1/reject" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "rejection_reason": "Invalid M-PESA code. The transaction RXJ123ABC could not be verified in our system. Please submit the correct M-PESA code."
  }'
```

## Security Considerations

### Backend Security ✅
- Only admins can reject deposits
- Rejection reason required (minimum 10 chars)
- Audit trail maintained (rejected_by, rejected_at)
- Authorization checks on all endpoints
- Cannot reject completed deposits

### Frontend Security ✅
- User can only view their own rejections
- Retry limit enforced client-side
- Support contact required after limit
- All rejection data validated

---

## Performance Optimizations

### Database ✅
- Index on `rejected_by` for admin queries
- Composite index on `(loan_id, status)` for filtering
- Soft deletes preserved for audit trail

### API ✅
- Eager loading relationships (rejector, loan)
- Efficient query scopes
- Pagination support where needed

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Rejection Rate:**
   - Total rejections / Total deposits
   - Track by admin, by reason

2. **Limit Reached:**
   - How many loans hit 3 rejections
   - Resolution time for these cases

3. **Dispute Rate:**
   - Rejections that get disputed
   - Successful dispute resolutions

4. **Common Rejection Reasons:**
   - Categorize and track patterns
   - Identify training needs

---

## Documentation Files Created

### Backend
1. `DEPOSIT_REJECTION_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` (this file)
2. `test-deposit-rejection.sh` - API testing script
3. Migration file with rejection fields

### Mobile App
1. `DEPOSIT_REJECTION_LOGIC.md` - Comprehensive guide
2. Enhanced Dart files with rejection logic

---

## Next Steps

### For Development Team:

1. **Test End-to-End Flow:**
   - Create test deposit
   - Reject it via admin panel
   - Verify mobile app displays rejection
   - Test retry functionality
   - Test limit enforcement

2. **Admin Panel Integration:**
   - Add rejection UI to admin panel
   - Display rejection count per loan
   - Show rejection history

3. **Notifications:**
   - Implement push notification service
   - Send SMS for rejections (optional)
   - Email notifications (optional)

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Set up analytics tracking
   - Create admin dashboard for rejection metrics
   - Alert admins when limit reached

### For QA Team:

- [ ] Test rejection flow with valid data
- [ ] Test rejection limit enforcement (3 rejections)
- [ ] Test dispute submission
- [ ] Test rejection history display
- [ ] Test notifications
- [ ] Test authorization (users can't reject)
- [ ] Test edge cases (null values, long rejection reasons)
