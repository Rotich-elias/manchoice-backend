# New User Loan Application Flow

## Overview
This document describes the updated loan application flow where users can sign up, fill the loan application form, pay the registration fee, and wait for admin approval before being able to take out loans.

## New Flow

### 1. User Sign Up
- User creates an account (no payment required)
- User is authenticated and can access the app
- Customer record is created with:
  - `credit_limit`: 0 (default)
  - `status`: 'active'
  - `registration_fee_paid`: false

### 2. Loan Application Submission
- User fills out the complete loan application form
- Uploads all required documents (ID, bike photos, logbook, etc.)
- Submits the application **without paying anything yet**
- System saves the loan with status: `awaiting_registration_fee`

**Response to user:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Loan application submitted successfully. Please pay the KES 300 registration fee to proceed.",
  "registration_fee_required": true,
  "registration_fee_amount": 300.00,
  "next_step": "Pay registration fee",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

### 3. Registration Fee Payment
- User pays KES 300 registration fee via M-PESA or cash
- System updates:
  - User: `registration_fee_paid` = true
  - Loan status: `awaiting_registration_fee` → `pending`

**Response to user:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Registration fee payment verified successfully. Your loan application will now be reviewed by admin.",
  "next_step": "Wait for admin to review your application and set your loan limit"
}
```

### 4. Admin Reviews Application
**Admin sees:**
- Loan in "Pending" status (after fee is paid)
- Customer with `credit_limit`: 0
- Warning: "⚠ Action Required: Set Loan Limit"
- Message: "This is a new customer with no approved loans. Please set their loan limit before approving or rejecting this application."

**Admin Actions:**
1. Reviews the application documents
2. Goes to customer profile
3. Sets appropriate credit limit (e.g., KES 50,000)
4. Returns to loan application
5. Approves or rejects the loan

### 5. Customer Gets Notified
- When admin sets the credit limit, customer is notified
- Customer can now see their credit limit in the app
- If loan is approved, customer gets the loan

### 6. Future Loan Applications
- Customer already has credit limit set
- Can apply for new loans directly
- No need to pay registration fee again
- Loans go straight to "pending" status (skip awaiting fee)

## Loan Status Flow

```

         ↓ (admin reviews)
         ↓ (admin sets credit limit if needed)
         ↓
    approved / rejected
         ↓ (if approved)
      active
         ↓ (after full payment)
    completed
```

### Customers Table

    ], 201);
}
```
